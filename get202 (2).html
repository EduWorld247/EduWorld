    Introduction to Engineering Materials 
  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content">
  <h2>Introduction to Engineering Materials</h2>
<p>
  The earliest humans had access to only a very limited number of materials—those that occur naturally—such as:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Stone</li>
  <li>Wood</li>
  <li>Clay</li>
  <li>Animal Skins</li>
</ol>

<p>
  <strong>Material Science</strong> focuses on investigating the relationship between the structure and properties of materials. A material scientist develops or synthesizes new materials.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Material Engineering</strong> applies the structure-property relationship to design or engineer materials to achieve desired properties. A material engineer designs products or systems using existing materials and may also develop new processing techniques.
</p>

<h2>Structure of Materials</h2>
<p>
  The structure of a material refers to the arrangement of its internal components. Structures can be examined at different levels:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Atomic Structure:</strong> The arrangement of atoms in a material, including bonding types.</li>
  <li><strong>Molecular Structure:</strong> Relevant mostly to polymers and organic materials.</li>
  <li><strong>Crystalline Structure:</strong> How atoms are arranged in a repeating pattern (lattice).</li>
  <li><strong>Microstructure:</strong> The structure observed under a microscope, such as grain boundaries and phases.</li>
  <li><strong>Macrostructure:</strong> Features visible to the naked eye, such as porosity, cracks, and surface finish.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The internal components of a material influence its properties significantly.
</p>

<h2>Properties of Solid Materials</h2>
<p>
  These properties are categorized into main groups or types:
</p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Mechanical</td>
      <td>Surface Hardness, Toughness, Strength</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Components of Material Science and Engineering</h2>
<p>
  These are interconnected aspects that define the study and application of materials:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Processing</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Structure</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Properties</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Performance</strong></li>
</ol>

<h2>Why Study Material Science and Engineering?</h2>
<p>
  Engineers often face the challenge of selecting the right material from thousands of available options. 
  Understanding the structure-property relationship and processing techniques helps engineers make confident, informed decisions.
</p>

<h2>Classification of Materials</h2>
<p>
  Solid materials are commonly classified into:
</p>

<h3>1. Metals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Composed of metallic elements (e.g., Fe, Al, Cu)</li>
  <li>May contain small amounts of non-metals (e.g., C, O)</li>
  <li>Contain non-localized (free) electrons</li>
  <li>High electrical and thermal conductivity</li>
  <li>Ductile and strong</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Ceramics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Compounds of metals and nonmetals (e.g., oxides, carbides)</li>
  <li>Strong, stiff, hard but brittle</li>
  <li>Poor electrical and thermal conductors</li>
  <li>Resistant to high temperatures and harsh environments</li>
  <li>Have optical properties (transparent, translucent, or opaque)</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Polymers</h3>

    Crystal Structures
  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content">
    <h2>Crystal Structures</h2>
<h3>Crystal Lattices and Unit Cells</h3>
<p>
  The arrangement of atoms in a material greatly influences its properties. Atoms in crystalline solids are arranged in a repeating, three-dimensional pattern known as a <strong>crystal lattice</strong>. This long-range order allows the material to maintain its shape and exhibit distinct physical properties.
</p>

<p>
  A <strong>crystal lattice</strong> is a regular geometric arrangement of atoms in space. A <strong>crystalline material</strong> has atoms arranged in a periodic pattern that extends in all directions. The physical properties of crystalline solids often depend heavily on this internal structure.
</p>

<p>
  A <strong>unit cell</strong> is the smallest repeating unit in a crystal lattice that, when repeated in all directions, creates the entire crystal structure. The unit cell defines the material's symmetry and many of its macroscopic properties.
</p>

<h3>Metallic Crystal Structures</h3>
<p>
  In metallic materials, atomic bonding is non-directional (metallic bonding). This allows atoms to pack closely in regular patterns. There are three main types of crystal structures found in engineering metals:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Face Centered Cubic (FCC)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Body Centered Cubic (BCC)</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Hexagonal Close Packed (HCP)</strong></li>
</ol>

<h4>1. Face Centered Cubic (FCC)</h4>
<p>
  The FCC structure has atoms at each corner of the cube and at the centers of all the cube faces. Metals with FCC structures include <strong>copper, aluminum, silver, and gold</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  FCC metals tend to be ductile and have excellent formability because they possess a higher number of slip systems, allowing atoms to move more easily under stress.
</p>
<h4>FCC Slip Systems</h4>
<p>
  Slip in crystals occurs along planes and directions with the highest atomic density. In FCC (Face Centered Cubic) structures, the most densely packed slip plane is the <strong>(111)</strong> plane, and the most favorable slip direction lies within this plane.
</p>
<p>
  FCC structures exhibit a high number of slip systems, which makes them highly ductile. Each (111) slip plane contains 3 independent slip directions. With 4 such planes in the FCC unit cell, this results in:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>4 slip planes × 3 directions per plane = <strong>12 slip systems</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Cube Edge Length and Atomic Radius in FCC</h4>
<p>
  In an FCC unit cell, the atoms at the corners and the face centers are in contact along the face diagonal. The relationship between the cube edge length <strong>a</strong> and the atomic radius <strong>r</strong> is:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>a = 2√2·r</strong>
</p>

<h4>Atomic Arrangement in FCC</h4>
<p>
  The FCC unit cell contains:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>8 corner atoms</strong>: Each shared among 8 unit cells (1/8 contribution each)</li>
  <li><strong>6 face-centered atoms</strong>: Each shared between 2 unit cells (1/2 contribution each)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Total number of atoms per FCC unit cell =
  (8 × 1/8) + (6 × 1/2) = <strong>4 atoms</strong>
</p>

<h4>Coordination Number and Atomic Packing Factor (APF)</h4>
<p>
  Two important characteristics of a crystal structure are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Coordination Number:</strong> The number of nearest neighbor atoms surrounding an atom.</li>
  <li><strong>Atomic Packing Factor (APF):</strong> The fraction of volume in a unit cell occupied by atoms.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  For FCC:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Coordination Number:</strong> 12 (each atom is in contact with 12 others)</li>
  <li><strong>APF:</strong> 0.74 (the highest possible for equal spheres in 3D)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Atomic Packing Factor (APF) for FCC</h4>
<p>
  The Atomic Packing Factor (APF) is defined as the ratio of the total volume of atoms within a unit cell to the total volume of the unit cell:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>APF = Volume of atoms in unit cell / Total volume of unit cell</strong>
</p>

<h5>1. Relationship Between Cube Edge Length and Atomic Radius</h5>
<p>
  In FCC, atoms touch along the face diagonal. The face diagonal is equal to 4R, where R is the atomic radius. Using Pythagoras theorem for a cube face:
</p>
<p>
  Face diagonal = √2 · a = 4R → <strong>a = 2√2 · R</strong>
</p>

<h5>2. Volume of FCC Unit Cell</h5>
<p>
  Volume of the cube (unit cell): <strong>V<sub>c</sub> = a³ = (2√2 · R)³ = 16√2 · R³</strong>
</p>

<h5>3. Number of Atoms in FCC Unit Cell</h5>
<ul>
  <li>8 corner atoms × (1/8 per unit cell) = 1 atom</li>
  <li>6 face-centered atoms × (1/2 per unit cell) = 3 atoms</li>
  <li><strong>Total = 4 atoms per FCC unit cell</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5>4. Volume of Atoms in FCC Unit Cell</h5>
<p>
  Volume of one atom (assumed spherical): <strong>V = (4/3)πR³</strong><br>
  Volume of 4 atoms: <strong>V<sub>s</sub> = 4 × (4/3)πR³ = (16/3)πR³</strong>
</p>

<h5>5. Atomic Packing Factor (APF)</h5>
<p>
  APF = V<sub>s</sub> / V<sub>c</sub> = [(16/3)πR³] / [16√2 · R³] = (π / (3√2)) ≈ <strong>0.74</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The APF for FCC is approximately <strong>0.74</strong>, which is the highest possible for identical spheres in 3D close packing.
</p>

<h4>Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Crystal Structure</h4>
<p>
  The Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) structure is one of the common crystal structures found in metals. In this structure:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atoms are located at all eight corners of the cube.</li>
  <li>There is one additional atom at the center of the cube.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Examples of metals with BCC structures include <strong>iron (α-Fe), chromium, and tungsten</strong>. BCC structures are generally less ductile than FCC but are stronger and more resistant to deformation, especially at high temperatures.
</p>

<h5>Number of Atoms in BCC Unit Cell</h5>
<ul>
  <li>8 corner atoms × (1/8 per unit cell) = 1 atom</li>
  <li>1 body-centered atom (fully within the unit cell) = 1 atom</li>
  <li><strong>Total = 2 atoms per BCC unit cell</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5>Coordination Number</h5>
<p>
  The coordination number of BCC is <strong>8</strong>, meaning each atom is in contact with 8 nearest neighbors.
</p>

<h5>Atomic Packing Factor (APF)</h5>
<p>
  The APF is the fraction of volume in a unit cell that is occupied by atoms:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>APF = Volume of atoms in unit cell / Total volume of unit cell</strong><br>
  = [2 × (4/3)πR³] / a³<br>
  For BCC, a = (4R) / √3 → a³ = [(4R)/√3]³ = (64R³)/(3√3)<br>
  APF ≈ <strong>0.68</strong>
</p>

<h5>Slip System in BCC</h5>
<p>
  BCC has more slip systems than FCC, but the slip planes are less densely packed, making BCC materials generally less ductile:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Slip plane: {110}</li>
  <li>Slip direction: [111]</li>
  <li>Total slip systems: 12</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h4>Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) Crystal Structure</h4>
<p>
  Not all metals crystallize in cubic symmetry. One important alternative is the <strong>Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP)</strong> structure.
</p>
<p>
  In HCP:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The top and bottom faces of the unit cell each contain 6 atoms arranged in a regular hexagon.</li>
  <li>There is 1 atom at the center of the top and bottom faces.</li>
  <li>3 atoms are located in the middle plane between top and bottom layers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Examples include <strong>magnesium, titanium, and zinc</strong>. HCP metals often have limited slip systems, making them less ductile than FCC metals.

      <h2>Atomic Structure</h2>
  <p>The atomic structure forms the foundation for understanding how materials behave. It determines the material’s properties like conductivity, strength, and thermal expansion.</p>
  <h3>Structure of Atoms</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>An atom consists of a central nucleus made up of protons and neutrons. The protons carry a positive charge, while neutrons have no charge. The nucleus is surrounded by electrons, which move in orbitals around the nucleus.</li>
    <li>The nucleus contains nearly all of the atom’s mass, while the electrons occupy energy levels or shells that orbit the nucleus.</li>
    <li>The arrangement and number of electrons in an atom’s outermost shell (the valence electrons) determine many of the material’s properties, including its ability to bond with other atoms.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Electron Configuration and Impact on Conductivity and Bonding</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Electron Configuration refers to the distribution of electrons across the various shells and orbitals in an atom. The electrons in the outermost shell, known as valence electrons, are crucial for chemical bonding and conductivity.</li>
    <li><strong>Conductivity:</strong> In metals, the valence electrons are not tightly bound to any particular atom, making them free to move and conduct electricity.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonding:</strong> Electron configuration influences how atoms bond—forming ionic, covalent, or metallic bonds depending on valence electron interactions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Atomic Bonding</h2>
  <p>The way atoms bond to form solids greatly influences material properties like strength, conductivity, and hardness. The four main types of atomic bonding include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Ionic Bonding:</strong>
      <p>Ionic bonds are formed when electrons are transferred from one atom to another, creating positively charged cations and negatively charged anions.</p>
      <p>Example: Sodium chloride (NaCl) – Sodium donates an electron to chlorine, forming Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Covalent Bonding:</strong>
      <p>Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electrons. They are found in ceramics and salts, typically brittle with high melting points but poor electrical conductivity.</p>
      <p>Example: Water (H₂O) – Oxygen shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms.</p>
      <p>Example: Diamond – A carbon structure with strong covalent bonds throughout, leading to extreme hardness.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Metallic Bonding:</strong>
      <p>In metallic bonding, valence electrons move freely across the structure in a “sea of electrons.”</p>
      <p>Example: Copper (Cu) – Free-moving electrons enable excellent electrical and thermal conductivity.</p>
      <p>Metallic bonds give rise to properties like malleability and strength.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <strong>Van der Waals Bonds:</strong>
      <p>Weak forces occurring between close atoms or molecules, not involving electron transfer or sharing.</p>
      <p>Example: Graphite – Layers are held together by Van der Waals forces.</p>
      <p>Common in polymers and soft materials due to their weak nature.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Introduction to Atomic Structures</h2>
  <p>Atomic structures are foundational to our understanding of the physical world. They describe how matter is built from atoms and how atoms interact to form complex substances.</p>
  <p>The exploration of atomic theory began in ancient Greece and evolved through centuries. Major advancements occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries thanks to pioneering scientists.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content">
    <h2>Introduction to electronic configuration</h2>
    <p>Electronic configuration refers to the distribution of electrons in an atom's electron shells or energy levels.</p>
    
    <h3>Key points in electronic configuration:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Energy Levels (Shells): Electrons in an atom are organized into energy levels, referred to as shells. These energy levels are labeled with the principal quantum number (n), where higher values of n correspond to higher energy levels. </li>
      <li>Sublevels (Subshells): Each energy level is composed of one or more sublevels, also known as subshells. The sublevels are labeled s, p, d, and f. The number of sublevels within an energy level is equal to the principal quantum number (n). For example, the first energy level (n=1) has one sublevel (s), the second energy level (n=2) has two sublevels (s and p), and so on.</li>
      <li>Orbitals: Sublevels are further divided into orbitals, which are regions within a sublevel where electrons are likely to be found. Orbitals are labeled using a combination of the sublevel and a specific magnetic quantum number (ml). The s sublevel has one orbital, the p sublevel has three orbitals, the d sublevel has five orbitals, and the f sublevel has seven orbitals.</li>

  Metals and alloys
  </div>
  <div class="collapsible-content">
    <h2>Materials, Metals, and Alloys</h2>
<p>Metals are polycrystalline substances composed of numerous fine crystals. Pure metals often exhibit low strength and lack the necessary properties for most engineering applications, which is why alloys—created by melting two metals or a metal with a non-metal—are often used to achieve superior characteristics.</p>
<p>Metals and alloys are classified into two major categories:</p>
<h2>Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metals</h2>

<h3>Ferrous Metals</h3>
<p>These metals have iron as their main constituent. Examples include:</p>

<h2>Polymers</h2>
<p>Polymers are large molecules made up of many repeating units chemically bonded into long chains. The word "polymer" comes from the Greek words for "many parts." These polymers are specifically made of small units bonded into long chains.</p>

<h3>Types of Polymers</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Organic Polymers:</strong> Primarily contain carbon and hydrogen. Examples: Polypropylene, Polystyrene.</li>
  <li><strong>Inorganic Polymers:</strong> Have a backbone made of elements other than carbon, such as silicon or phosphorus.</li>

  <li><strong>Nylon:</strong> Contains nitrogen.</li>
  <li><strong>Teflon:</strong> Contains fluorine.</li>
  <li><strong>Polyester and Polycarbonates:</strong> Contain oxygen.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Natural Polymers</h3>
<p>Examples of natural polymers include silk, cotton, and wool.</p>

<h3>Polymer Classification</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Elastomers</li>
  <li>Thermoset/Thermosetting Polymers</li>
  <li>Thermoplastics
    <ul>
      <li>Crystalline</li>
      <li>Amorphous</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Elastomers</h3>
<p>Elastomer plastics are typically chain, branched, or even network types, where the polymer chains are very loosely intertwined. This structure makes elastomers pliable and stretchy. Another name for elastomers is rubber. An example is silicone rubber, used for its flexibility and stretchability in various applications.</p>

<h3>Thermoplastics</h3>
<p>Thermoplastics soften and melt when heated and harden when cooled, allowing processes like injection moulding and extrusion. They can be reground and reused, though with some property loss.</p>

<h4>Amorphous Polymers</h4>
<p>These are hard and rigid below a specific temperature called the glass transition temperature.</p>

<h4>Crystalline/Semi-Crystalline Polymers</h4>
<p>They have better rigidity, hardness, density, lubricity, creep resistance, and solvent resistance than amorphous polymers. Generally, higher glass transition temperatures mean better high-temperature performance.</p>

<h3>Thermosets / Thermosetting Polymers</h3>
<p>Thermosets form cross-links between neighbouring polymer molecules, limiting chain movement. They degrade, rather than soften, under excessive heat. While they were once considered non-recyclable, new recycling technologies now allow for some reuse after curing.</p>

<h3>Properties of Polymers/Plastics</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Electrical Insulation:</strong> Do not conduct electricity, important for safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Useful in packaging to view contents.</li>

  <div class="collapsible-content">
    
   <h2>Cooling curve</h2>
<p>A cooling curve is a line graph that represents the change in the phases of matter. Below is 
an example of a cooling curve for a pure substance.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\REDEEMERS\Pictures\cooling-curve-6-638.webp" alt="" class="img1">

<h2>Phase Diagram</h2>
<p>A phase diagram is a graphical representation of the physical states of a substance 
under the conditions of varying temperature (x-axis) and pressure (y-axis). Phase diagrams are 
always drawn at equilibrium state because a system always tries to be stable. Phase diagrams are classified 
as under:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unary phase diagram (single component systems)</li>
  <li>Binary phase diagram (two component systems)</li>
  <li>Ternary phase diagram (three component systems)</li>
  <li>Quaternary phase diagram (four component systems)</li> 
  <li>And so on.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Unary Phase Diagram</h3>
<p>A unary phase diagram is a graphical representation of the phases of a single component system 
as a function of temperature and pressure. The diagram shows the different phases (solid, liquid, 
gas) that can exist at various temperatures and pressures.</p>
<p>In a unary phase diagram, the x-axis typically represents temperature, while the y-axis represents
pressure. The diagram is divided into different regions, each representing a specific phase of the 
substance. The boundaries between these regions indicate the conditions under which phase transitions 
occur, such as melting, boiling, or sublimation.</p>

  <p>Unary Phase Diagram of Iron</p>
  <img src="C:\Users\REDEEMERS\Pictures\Screenshot 2025-05-23 180254.png" alt="" class="img1">
  <ul style="color: white;">
    <li>The diagram illustrates different phases of iron as a function of temperature and pressure.</li>
    <li>Gaseous, liquid, and solid forms of iron are single phases, such as BCC, FCC, etc.</li>
    <li>The boundaries labeled AB, CDE, FDE, GHJ, GHK represent phase boundaries.</li>
    <li>Triple points are located on boundaries D and H.</li>
    <li>Along phase boundaries like AB, CDE, FDE, GHJ, and GHK, the degree of freedom (D) is 1, meaning temperature or pressure can be varied without changing the phase.</li>
    <li>At points D and H, which are triple points, three phases coexist in equilibrium, so D=0. Changes in temperature or pressure at these points cause the system to leave the triple point.</li>
    <li>The crystal structures of BCC, FCC, and BCC phases are obtained at increasing temperatures.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h3>Binary Phase Diagram</h3>
<p>A binary phase diagram graphically depicts the phases of a two-component system as a function of temperature and composition. It shows how the phases of the two components interact at different temperatures and compositions.</p>
<p>Gibbs phase rule: D = C - P + 1</p>
<p>Where D = degrees of freedom, C = number of components, and P = number of phases.</p>

<div class="edit">
  <p>Binary Phase Diagram</p>
  <img src="C:\Users\REDEEMERS\Pictures\Screenshot 2025-05-23 183738.png" alt="" class="img1">
  <ul style="color: white;">
    <li>This binary phase diagram is divided into liquid and solid phases.</li>
    <li>The phase below the temperature line TsMNTl represents the solid phase.</li>
    <li>The phase above the temperature line TsQTl corresponds to the liquid phase.</li>
    <li>Between these limits, both liquid and solid phases coexist (L + S).</li>
    <li>The boundary between the solid phase and the L + S region is called the solidus line.</li>
    <li>The boundary between the liquid phase and the L + S region is called the liquidus line.</li>
    <li>The two components are A and B, with their respective weight percentages. A varies from 0 to 100% from left to right; B varies from 100% to 0% from left to right.</li>
    <li>The tie line, such as line QN at temperature T1, is a horizontal line connecting the compositions of coexisting phases.</li>
    <li>The intersection of the tie line with the liquidus at point Q indicates the liquid composition (Cₗ), while the intersection with the solidus at point N indicates the solid composition (Cₛ).</li>
    <li>In single-phase regions, the degrees of freedom are calculated as D = c - p + 1; for example, D = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2.</li>
    <li>In two-phase regions, D = c - p + 1; for example, D = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1.</li>
